		<description>The Oldsmobile Light Tonneau, introduced in 1905, was an early automobile featuring a larger, more powerful design compared to the earlier Curved Dash model. It had a four-seat, open-top body style known as a "tonneau," with a rear seating area that could be accessed via a side door. Powered by a two-cylinder engine, it offered more horsepower and improved performance.\n\nConsumes a lot of fuel, and is best used for short to medium distances.\n\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Crew:&lt;/color&gt; Driver x1, Passenger x2\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Fuel type:&lt;/color&gt; Chemfuel</description>
