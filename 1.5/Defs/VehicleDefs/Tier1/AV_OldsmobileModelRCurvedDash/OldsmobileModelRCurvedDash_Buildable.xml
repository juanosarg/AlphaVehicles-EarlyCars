		<label>Oldsmobile Curved Dash</label>
		<description>Produced from 1901 to 1907, the Oldsmobile Model R, "Curved Dash" was the first mass-produced car in the world. It featured a distinctive curved front dash (hence the name) and was powered by a single-cylinder engine, producing about 5 horsepower. Affordable and reliable, it became one of the most popular early automobiles, helping to establish Oldsmobile as a key player in the emerging car industry.\n\nConsumes a lot of fuel, and is best used for short to medium distances.\n\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Crew:&lt;/color&gt; Driver x1\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Fuel type:&lt;/color&gt; Chemfuel</description>
